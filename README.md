# Anky

Anky is a decentralized journaling and self-reflection platform that helps you connect with your inner self through timed 8-minute writing sessions, guided by an 8-second countdown timer that ends your session as soon as it ends.

## Core Features

- **Timed Writing Sessions**: Engage in focused 8-minute writing sessions with an 8-second countdown timer
- **Blockchain Integration**: Your reflections are securely stored on base
- **Tokenomics**: For the upcoming sojourn (96 day cycle), each successful session earns every user 2675 $newen tokens. Max 1 session per day.
- **Farcaster Integration**: Share your insights with the community: anky is a farcaster client, and every account is a new fid.
- **Private & Secure**: We need to figure out how to make this happen.
