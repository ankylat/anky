# Anky

Anky is a decentralized journaling and self-reflection platform that helps you connect with your inner self through timed 8-minute writing sessions, guided by an 8-second countdown timer that signals when to start writing.

## Core Features

- **Timed Writing Sessions**: Engage in focused 8-minute writing sessions with an 8-second countdown timer
- **Blockchain Integration**: Your reflections are securely stored on Degen Chain and optionally tokenized
- **Triple-Tier Token System**: Earn three types of $newen tokens:
  - aether (worth 2675 - 666 - 333 = 1676 $newen): Rare tokens earned through exceptional writing consistency
  - lumina (worth 666 $newen): Intermediate tokens for regular participation
  - newensito (worth 333 $newen): Base tokens for completing sessions
- **Farcaster Integration**: Share your insights with the community
- **Private & Secure**: End-to-end encryption for your personal reflections
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on web and mobile devices

For this upcoming sojourn, the user will get the total of 2675 $newen tokens to start with for every successful 8 minute writing session. This is one per day, so you will only be able to mine (through PoW - Proof of Writing) 2675 $newen tokens per day, in the form of 1 aether coin, one lumina coin, and one newensito coin.
